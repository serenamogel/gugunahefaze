This week we take a look at the WWE Hall of Champions Series 3 Ultimate Warrior figure! This is exclusive to Target stores. Let’s take a look!</p><h4>The Packaging</h4><p>Here you can see Warrior holding a white strap winged eagle title. He comes in the same packaging Series 1 & 2 did with the awesome blue and gold design. Not to mention the background featuring shelves of championship belts over the years, which is pretty cool. One side has an image of Warrior as well as his name and the year it’s based on, which was 1990 when he won the winged eagle title. Looking at the back fo the box it shows a larger image of Warrior as well as has some info about him winning the belt. Also in the set are The New Age Outlaws Roadd Dogg and Billy Gunn as well as Paul Bearer.</p><h4>The Head Scan</h4><p>This is my favorite Warrior scan to date. It’s different than all of his other figures, too. It looks a bit cartoony to me but I still think it’s great as it has his mullet and screaming expression. Granted, some of his past figures have the scream look but at least this is an all new head we’ve never seen before. The detail from the face paint to the teeth and mouth are fantastic touches.</p><h4>The Attire</h4><p>The attire is pretty cool and very detailed, too. It gives me a Seattle Seahawks type vibe, which is kind of fun, especially if you’re a fan. You can see how it says Ultimate Warrior on his rear as well as has the Warrior logo along the crotch area of his trunks. Rumor has it some were released with two logos versus three but I’ve only seen that mentioned once so far. It could’ve been an error or a running change.</p><p>You can see different colored tassels hanging from around his biceps. It’s too bad they’re not cloth like Jakks Pacific used to do as that would make the figure even cooler. Warrior has his gauntlets on his wrists with molded tassels hanging down as well as his Warrior logos on the gauntlets themselves. His kneepads have the Warrior logos on them as well as molded tassels dangling down. &nbsp;Moving down to his vibrant yellow boots you can see the molded tassel like design as well as the Warrior logos on his toes with some white trim underneath his feet.</p><h4>The Articulation</h4><p>His articulation is like any other Elite figure, making him quite poseable. His knee pads are open in the back, making his knees even easier to bend. His ankles are a bit restricted due to the tassel-like boot design but other than that the figure is very poseable as a whole.</p><h4>Th Winged Eagle</h4><p>The belt is very cool honestly as it is very detailed. The white strap is really slick and clean looking, making this belt stand out amongst all the previously released Winged Eagle titles. In the original prototype images Warrior was pictured with a yellow one but thankfully they fixed that prior to release. For those whom like to collect the belts collectors will be all over this figure and there’s no reason not to be. You can size the belt accordingly with the holes and tabs on the back of the strap.</p><h4>Overall</h4><p>I really like this Warrior figure a lot. The detail is great and it looks pretty different to most of his recent figures, the head especially. I highly recommend picking him up if you can at Target. Unfortunately this is the last of the Hall of Champions series but who knows what we will see next as far as exclusives go.</p><p>For more wrestling figure news and coverage be sure to follow my popular <a href=# rel=noopener>Wrestling Figure News Twitter</a>!
