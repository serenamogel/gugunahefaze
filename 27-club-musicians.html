Soon after, his career would take off with his newly formed band, the Jimi Hendrix Experience, and earn him a trio of top ten hits in the United Kingdom. But Hendrix's star would burn bright for only four short years.

An artistic innovator, Jones was one of the first Brits to play slide guitar, and he later became a multi-instrumentalist. His seven years with the Rolling Stones were crucial in laying out the band's foundation, but his growing tension with the band's manager began contributing to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/brian-jones-sympathy-for-the-devil-182761/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="his downfall" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">his downfall</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">It didn't help that Jones was heavily abusing drugs and alcohol around the same time, which caused him to be unreliable and erratic, estranging him from the rest of the band.
