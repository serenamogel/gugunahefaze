Known for her accessibility and body confidence, Graham has been described as an ambassador of the "real beauty" movement, which celebrates what real women's bodies look like rather than the impossible standards set by the fashion industry. With her increasing popularity, she has graced the covers of the world's biggest fashion magazines, including Vogue, Elle, and Harper's Bazaar and has walked the runway for major fashion brands and designers.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Sports Illustrated Cover</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Making history in 2016, Graham became the first curvy model to grace the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“It was an eye-opening experience for me in that ‘Oh my God, I can do anything I want,’” Graham said about her history-making moment. “When you’re given an SI cover and you take advantage of it, you can conquer the world."</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Height, Weight & Size</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Graham is 5 foot 9 1/2 inches tall and weighs 200 lbs. She is a size 14.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Husband and Son</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Graham first met her husband Justin Ervin, a documentary filmmaker and cinematographer, while attending church.

"And he said to me, 'Racism is never surprising, but it's always disappointing.'"</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Net Worth</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Graham's net worth is reportedly around $10 million.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Brand Building: Bathing Suits, a Book & Even a Barbie</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Having become a global fashion star, Graham has launched a bathing suit line at Swimsuits for All, a lingerie line at Addition Elle, and a clothing line at Dress Barn. In 2016 Mattel approached the model to create a Barbie in her likeness, which she agreed to under the condition that the doll would have no thigh gap. Ever busy building her brand, Graham became an author a year later with the release of her memoir A New Model: What Confidence, Beauty, and Power Really Look Like.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">"I'm having a moment, but I've been having a moment a little while right now, and I'm so thankful for it," Graham stated in an interview with CBS. "Not only are you seeing women who have my body shape, who are bigger, who are smaller, whatever; you see the industry changing right before your eyes. You can have an 'it' moment, but you have to know how to continue to move this movement into something that's bigger than yourself."</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Modeling Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Graham was discovered at the age of 12 at a shopping mall in Lincoln, Nebraska.
