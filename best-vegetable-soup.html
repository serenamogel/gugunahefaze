Garden Vegetable Soup With Pasta</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><p>This is one of the <a href=#>best vegetarian soups</a> out there if you truly love vegetables. There are big pieces of veggies and a broth rich with roasted red pepper and tomato flavor. It’s herby and not too salty and super delicious. The pasta is still al dente, despite living in a can for who knows how long. If you want a truly vegetable-forward canned vegetable soup, this one is for you! There are so many options from Campbells and this is easily our favorite.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best vegetable soup" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RANKING-UPDATE_VEGGIE-SOUP_INSET-04.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best with Pasta</p><strong>Progresso Vegetable Soup</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Walmart</a><p>Much like in the Campbells Well Yes! Garden Vegetable soup, pasta is a welcome addition to this vegetable soup. I like this classic vegetable soup from Progresso because the vegetables and the pasta are both done well. It’s very mild and has big chunks of veggies floating in the broth. This is the best vegetable soup to have in the pantry if you come down with a cold. It has more oomph than chicken noodle but is still plain enough to soothe an upset stomach or stuffy nose. Plus, you can find Progresso in almost every grocery store and it’s often on sale. A win for affordability.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Walmart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best canned vegetable soup" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RANKING-UPDATE_VEGGIE-SOUP_INSET-03.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best for Veg Lovers</p><strong>Trader Joe’s Garden Vegetable Soup</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Affiliate</a><p>If you want the best vegetable soup that is heavy on the vegetables, grab a jar of Trader Joe’s Garden Vegetable Soup. It has a great mix of different veggies, making it the best canned vegetable soup for veg fanatics. It’s packed with sweet potatoes, carrots, tomatoes, zucchini, bell peppers, and leafy greens. A bonus feature is that this soup comes in a glass jar instead of a can. The reusability factor makes it easy to store your leftovers. Keep it after you’re done with your soup and you can store anything in it. Tasty and eco-friendly!</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Trader Joe’s</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best vegetable soup" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RANKING-UPDATE_VEGGIE-SOUP_INSET-02.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Reduced Sodium</p><strong>Amy’s Organic French Country Vegetable Soup</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Pavilions</a><p>I’ll say what we’re all thinking: All canned vegetable soups should have beans. It makes it so much heartier and more delicious! I love beans. That’s one of the big reasons I loved Amy’s Reduced Sodium French Country Vegetable Soup. It also includes long-grain rice, which makes it so filling and comforting. I could totally see this canned vegetable soup sustaining you as you tend to your sheep in the fields of the French countryside. Please don’t come for me if you’re a French farmer. I’m a comedian and soup lover who lives in L.A. so I’m just taking a guess.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Pavillions</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>10/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best vegetable soup" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RANKING-UPDATE_VEGGIE-SOUP_INSET-01.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best of the Best</p><strong>Amy’s Organic Southwestern Fire Roasted Vegetable Soup</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Walmart</a><p>Imagine the best vegetable soup you ever tasted had a baby with a perfectly spiced tortilla soup—that’s Amy’s Southwest Vegetable Soup in a nutshell. What’s not to love? It’s wonderfully seasoned and would be great on its own, but would also be great topped with shredded cheddar, diced raw onion, and a squeeze of fresh lime. You could even scoop it up with some tortilla chips or spoon it over a baked potato. I love a vegetable soup that is versatile. This one isn’t just versatile, it’s bursting with flavor and was the best veggie soup we tried during our taste test.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Walmart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>10/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><p><strong>Other Products We Tried:</strong><br>Amy’s Chunky Vegetable Soup, Progresso Vegetarian Vegetable Soup, Progresso Garden Vegetable Soup, Pacific Foods Hearty Vegetable Soup, McDougall’s Lower Sodium Vegetable Soup, Healthy Valley Campbell’s Vegetarian Vegetable Soup, Campbell’s Chunky Savory Vegetable, Signature Select Condensed Vegetable Soup, Trader Joe’s Autumnal Harvest Soup</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJqVqMFuwsSgnK2ZkqGybr%2FOrqdo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pea-pesto.html><span>←</span><span>Lemony Pea Pesto</span></a>
