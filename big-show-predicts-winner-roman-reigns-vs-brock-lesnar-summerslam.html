You gotta give Roman the opportunity. He’s never quit, he’s got so much fight. I’ve seen Roman take so many beatdowns and unlike most people… Most people quit the business. He’s got heart, he’s got guts and he knows what it is like to be a locker room leader now. So I think whatever happens at SummerSlam, if Roman Reigns doesn’t come home with the Championship, then that is it for Roman Reigns. I don’t think by any means that boy has quit in him, so I’m saying it’s not ‘if’ for Roman Reigns. I’m gonna say Roman is going to take it to Brock like never before.”</p><p>You can check out his remarks below.</p><p><strong>Who do you predict leaves SummerSlam as Champion?
