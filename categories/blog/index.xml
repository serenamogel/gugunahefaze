As it turns out, black ink isn’t opaque enough for these ancient scantron devices to function properly. Furthermore, lighter shades of graphite, such as those found in #3 and #4 pencils, were not opaque enough to allow these ancient systems to operate error-free, as was often needed.
As a result, what happens if you use a number 3 pencil on the SAT is not clear. It’s unlikely that using a number 3 pencil will give you any issues in the future.</description></item><item><title>Frozen Chocolate Bananas</title><link>/frozen-chocolate-bananas.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/frozen-chocolate-bananas.html</guid><description>vegan / gluten free
