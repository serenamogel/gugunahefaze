Byrne has filled the cast with standup comedians and writers: Bill Burr, Ken Jeong, Tom Segura, Neal Brennan, Alex Moffat, Bonnie Hellman, Russell Peters, all of whom play cameo roles. You can tell that "The Opening Act" was written by someone who knows the field intimately, and much of it feels semi-autobiographical. When comics sit around and "talk shop," they don't revel in their triumphs. They commiserate on the moments they bombed, or dealt with horrible hecklers, or didn't have enough material to fill their time slot, of hearing "</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Is Blake Shelton Sick?

<a href=../../../../ice-age-collision-course-2016.html></a>
Clearly, the makers of the “Ice&nbsp;Age” series are running out of ideas for the main trio. They have to maintain the resonating, heartfelt premise—you don’t have to be related or even the same species to be a family—that is primarily responsible for the previous four flicks grossing an astonishing $2.8 billion worldwide total. But “Collision Course” attempts to solve its sequel fatigue by giving more screen time to side characters from previous chapters and promoting Brit wit Simon Pegg’s hyperactive one-eyed swashbuckling weasel Buck into a breakout status, as he and a trio of nefarious flying dinosaurs escape from the lost world featured in the third “Ice&nbsp;Age” film.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Prince Harry's Vince Shoes are On Sale Right Now</h2><time>Jul 16, 2024</time>
