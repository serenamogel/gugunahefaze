All of our friends are back, and some new ones, including a ferocious T-Rex and a sexy rival for Scrat the squirrel, named Scratt√®, accent grave over the √®. As befits this land before time, Scrattand Scratt√® are sabre-toothed squirrels. No wonder the big teeth died out. They're of more use to a carnivore than a vegetarian. But logic like this is of no use in a movie where Sid the Sloth (voice by John Leguizamo) adopts three dinosaur eggs and plans to raise the babies.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Sweet Dreams movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2024)</h2><time>Oct 1, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../../sweet-dreams-film-review-2024.html></a>
As directed by&nbsp;Sendijareviƒá, shot by&nbsp;Emo Weemhoff and edited by&nbsp;Lot Rossmark,&nbsp;"Sweet Dreams"&nbsp;is aestheticized within a millimeter&nbsp;of its life. The movie is shot in the squarish, 4x3 "Academy"&nbsp;ratio, mostly through wide-angle lenses that cartoonishly distort people and objects (especially when the camera shifts position quickly). Almost every establishing shot is symmetrically framed, not in the manner of a&nbsp;Stanley Kubrick or Wes Anderson, but fetishistic fan art inspired by them. Objects and people&nbsp;within each shot are arranged like elements in a glassed-in art installation.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Ryan Reynolds reveals which film is guaranteed to make him cry</h2><time>Sep 30, 2024</time>

Set in a dystopian timeline, the film tells us of Japan's collapse and massive unemployment. Its government has passed a law to reign in a restive student populace. Draconian is the mildest way to describe it, as teenage students are isolated and forced against their will to kill each other off until there is one left standing. All at the behest of a school teacher named Kitano, not surprisingly played by the iconic Takeshi Kitano, who at once embodies authority with a dangerous edge.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Does Scream VI have a post-credits scene?</h2><time>Sep 29, 2024</time>
