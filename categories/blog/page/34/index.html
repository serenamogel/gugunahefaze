Originally announced in 2022, “Orphan Black: Echoes” takes place in the same universe as its predecessor, though several decades into the future.

Two particular sentences capture the essence of Dune: Part Two, and one cannot exist without the other. The first: “Frank Herbert’s legendary novel continues its reputation for being unfilmable.” The second: “Denis Villeneuve is more than capable of pulling all the right strings and pushing all the right buttons to come admirably, if only relatively, close to the feat.”

<a href=../../../../unproven-casting-rumors-lead-to-a-soon-to-be-former-dcu-star-getting-called-out-for-abuse-allegations.html></a>
Unless something drastic changes, it would be safe to assume that the overwhelming majority – if not all – cast members from the Shazam! franchise are on their way out of the DCU, even if star Zachary Levi does have a close personal friendship with co-CEOs James Gunn and Peter Safran.
