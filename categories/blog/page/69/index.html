<a href=../../../../saw-the-final-chapter-blu-ray-review.html></a>
Recommended Videos Ah yes, so here we are, the end of the Saw franchise. To be perfectly honest, the franchise should have ended a while ago. It went on far too long. It’s no secret that the original was the best and to this day, still stands as one of my favorite horror films. From that point on, the films got progressively worse. Sure, there were some great moments along the way, but nothing was able to compare to the first.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Fear Street Part Two: 1978 Cast, Actors, Producer, Director, Roles, Salary</h2><time>Feb 9, 2024</time>

<a href=../../../../best-olipop-flavors.html></a>
I was raised in a household in which diet soda was verboten. In the ’80s, everyone was super paranoid about artificial sweeteners like aspartame (maybe for good reason, I don’t know) and my mother was among them, so it was full-sugar soda or the highway, baby. Today, we have so many more carbonated beverage options than just regular or diet soda, and it’s a beautiful thing. You’ve got your unsweetened fruit-flavored seltzers like Waterloo and Polar; those very sweet (but very delicious) juice-based sodas from Sanpellegrino; those not-too-sweet juice-based seltzers from Spindrift—truly a world of fizzy options.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Harlan Crow Biography, Education, Career, Controversies, And Net Worth</h2><time>Feb 8, 2024</time>

<a href=../../../../eating-banana-wrong.html></a>
You know that feeling of being called out for doing something weird? That “Oh no, I’m completely alone here” moment? At first it’s embarrassing, but then it somehow becomes empowering, right? Being backed into a corner, forced to die on a hill that you never intended to be on in the first place?
Well, I recently experienced that array of emotions when I found out I have been eating a banana wrong my whole life.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../../categories/blog/page/68/>← Prev Page</a>
