Fans loved the <a href=#>song even before Jericho used</a> it as an entrance song, but AEW took full advantage of that fact.</p><p>Jericho is in a rare position where he gets to cash a royalty check every time he comes to the ring. All that exposure for Judas also helped make the song a popular one for fans all over, as their YouTube video raked up a ton of views in the process.</p><p><a href=#>While taking to Rock 97.6</a> Chris Jericho opened up about how his band’s song paved the way for so many other tunes that fans love to sing along with. He mentioned Seth Rollins and Jungle Boy’s music as songs that get fans singing, but Judas was a “pioneer” of that practice.</p><p>“Now it has definitely become a thing, it’s now to the point where other people’s ring songs are being sung with. I’m talking about Jungle Boy or even Seth Rollins in WWE.”</p><p>“It’s almost like “Judas” was the pioneer of that and the fans have so much fun singing that one they want to sing other ones as well, and that’s great. But “Judas” was kind of one of the first for that.”</p><p>AEW fans love singing along with Fozzy’s Judas, but they are also a musical bunch in general. Chris Jericho has even brought heat on himself in the past by not playing Judas for fans to sing along with.</p><p>Tony Khan has arranged a few songs on the roster that fans love belting out as wrestles make their way to the ring. We can’t say that Judas deserves credit for all of those sing-along songs, but fans certainly love to shout out the lyrics of that banger.</p><p>What’s your take on wrestling fans singing along with theme songs?
