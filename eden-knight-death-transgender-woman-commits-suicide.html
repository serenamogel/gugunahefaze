She hoped for trans rights worldwide and bid farewell.</p><p>Her partner, known on Twitter as Parker, mourned her loss and promised to carry her memory with him for the rest of his life.</p><p>She stated, <strong>“I wanted to be a leader for people like me, but that wasn’t written to happen. I hope that the world gets better for us. I hope our people get old. I hope we get to see our kids grow up to fight for us.
