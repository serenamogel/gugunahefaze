He was known as an active legislator and an advocate for the confiscation of Loyalist property. Like John Rutledge, Edward Rutledge opposed the Jay Treaty and the Anglophilic stance he perceived in the Federalist Party. As an elector in the 1796 Presidential Election, Rutledge voted for the two Southern candidates, Republican Thomas Jefferson and Federalist Thomas Pinckney. Rutledge had not been close with the eventual <a href=#>Victor</a> <a href=#>John Adams</a> dating back to their days in the Continental Congress, but he approved of Adams's defense policies towards <a href=#>France</a> during the Quasi-War. The opposition afforded Adams's measures by Vice <a href=#>President</a> Jefferson and the Congressional Republicans angered Rutledge because he now saw the Republicans as more partial to <a href=#>France</a> than to <a href=#>American</a> interests, a situation similar to the pro-British feelings he sensed in the Federalists during the Jay Treaty debates. Rutledge thereafter ceased communication with Jefferson. Rutledge served in the state senate for two years, then was elected governor in 1798.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeVmcSivsNmqa6spKGybrrErWSwp6KptW6Ckm9vbQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./candy-clark-net-worth-income-salary-html.html><span>←</span><span>Candy Clark Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
