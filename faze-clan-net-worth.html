<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Faze Clan Net Worth</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>A group of Call on Duty aficionados got together a decade ago to build a network of like-minded video-gamers who could compete in popular video games. The team has competed in every Call of Duty title since they first started in 2010. Today with over 70 members, it is an organization all by itself. FazeClan is recognized worldwide as a multi-game esports team and YouTube video producer that has vastly contributed to the way the video game is perceived.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=inception></span>Inception<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Way back in 2010, on 30 May, three young video gaming enthusiasts got together to build a Call on Duty clan. The world best remembers them as FaZe ClipZ, FaZe Resistance, and FaZe Housecat (Timid). They were credited with introducing trick shooting. While the style was practiced in gaming previously as well, no one attempted to give it a shot as a team. This style is mostly used by snipers in Call of Duty to make the game more interesting and complex. The maneuvers include spinning and using button combinations on the controller to generate a unique no scope shot.</p><p>Initially, the clan just introduced themselves on YouTube through a dedicated channel. Once Faze Fakie joined the clan, their popularity started bolstering. They had new content and a more organized approach to gaming. Faze Clan started the popular series ILLCAMS. Finally, in 2014, Thomas ‘Temperrr’ Oliveira, responsible for most of Faze Clan’s operations and also its CEO, introduced Richard ‘Banks’ Bengston into the clan. With this change in administration, FaZe Clan’s content brought about a whole new narrative into gaming by incorporating lifestyle content with gaming content.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=evolution></span>Evolution<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Once the clan got going, they decided to expand, and in May 2014, they created a second-team, FaZe Black. But later, Faze Black was dissolved. On 5 December 2014, they announced that they were starting a sub-division, Red Reserve or Faze Red. The plan was the team would upload Call of Duty sniper montages to their YouTube channel in partnership with FaZe Clan till the end of June 2016.</p><p>The intention was in two years’ time once Red Reserve built its own credibility, Faze Clan would break off the partnership. But unfortunately, the plan did not materialize, and Faze Red merged with Faze Clan with no separate identity. On similar lines, Faze Clan decided to partner with the Atlanta Esports Ventures, an American professional Call of Duty League (CDL) esports team, to build Atlanta FaZe in October 2019.</p><p>2020 brings more prosperity to the organization with them expanding into the Asian market. They acquired a PUBG Mobile and FIFA Online roster, both of which are a rage in Asia. On 12 February 2020, Faze clan made their next major announcement revealing that they were going to collaborate with the Ronald McDonald House Charity in Los Angeles to come up with a gaming lounge in the charity building.</p><p>While a few members of the clan have moved on, the organization seems to be at an all-time high boasting of over 70 members. Some of the popular members are FaZe Temperrr, FaZe CBass, FaZe Banks, FaZe Fakie, FaZe Apex, FaZe Jinx, FaZe HugZ, FaZe Spratt, FaZe PryZee, FaZe Ramos, FaZe Agony, FaZe Niqs, FaZe Twistt, FaZe Zayzo, FaZe Benji, FaZe Swan, FaZe ZiiMeR, FaZe Qualityy, FaZe Rain, FaZe Rug, FaZe Aquas, FaZe Rebirthh, FaZe Hateful, FaZe Faytal, FaZe Meek, FaZe StyL, FaZe Diirty, FaZe Bobo, FaZe Brio, FaZe Rockst4r, FaZe BaZi, FaZe Gwidt, FaZe Karma, FaZe Eski, FaZe Racky, FaZe Caarl, FaZe Xero, FaZe Markoh, FaZe Loams, FaZe Kayos, FaZe Jevs, FaZe Kross, FaZe Sullys, FaZe iiPod, FaZe Flushed, FaZe Kay, FaZe Mancat, FaZe RePlays, FaZe OutCST, FaZe Linkzy, FaZe Adapt, FaZe Strobe, FaZe Bloomao, FaZe Veizuh, and FaZe NinjaSK. The original FaZe Clan YouTube channel has approximately 4.5 million subscribers, with FaZe Rug having the highest number of subscribers.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=awards-and-achievements></span>Awards and Achievements<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Faze Clan has been at the helm of things and won innumerable online gaming championships. On 18 August 2019, they were placed thirteenth in the Call of Duty World League Championship, earning $25,000. July 2019, they were placed third in CWL Pro League Playoffs, winning $200,000. In January the same year, they took the third position in CMG ProDown 5. They also won the 2018 CWL Pro League Stage 1, making a whopping $212,500 in earnings. In Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Europe ranks ninth and has a win rate of 53% and total earnings of $57000.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=net-worth-of-faze-clan></span>Net Worth of Faze Clan<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Faze Clan started off as a new gaming initiative, but today has a net worth of nearly $8 million as of January 2021. Almost 40% of the net worth comes from participating in esports and from winning e-gaming events. As per the esports rosters, Faze Clan has earned $8,816,881.47 from 301 tournaments. The remaining, which is nearly $5 million, comes in the form of endorsements, sponsorships, and contracts.</p><p>Most of the games that they earn from are Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Call of Duty, and Overwatch. The latter was something that they expanded into in June 2016.</p><p>Faze Clan’s popularity is far-reaching. They have been making loads of money through gaming alone. Their memberships increased 20 times in ten years, and still more youngsters are enrolling. The group is constantly innovating and improving themselves.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJ6Rr7Jur8uapWamlal6uLvRrZ9o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bruce-mitchell-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Bruce Mitchell Net Worth 2024</span></a>
