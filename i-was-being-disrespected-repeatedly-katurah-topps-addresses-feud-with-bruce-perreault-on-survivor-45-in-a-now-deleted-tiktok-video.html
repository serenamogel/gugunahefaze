Recommended Videos With the “New Era” of Survivor often being criticized for the lack of drama and feuds between its castaways — often being referred to as Kumbaya Survivor — viewers have been loving the beef between Katurah and Bruce throughout this season thus far."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

I’m still talking about Bruce. Damn! They still got me talking about Bruce. Damn! I’m still in the confessional talking about Bruce.’ Like, what is happening, because I know me and obviously I know I would never just only be talking about Bruce. Surely that’s not what’s happening,” Katurah shared in said TikTok video, expressing her confusion.</p><p data-characters=384 data-current-count=384 data-injectable=false>She then put the rumors to rest, explaining that having an annoying tribemate was never an issue for her. In Katurah’s eyes, having a person that is drawing a lot of attention and annoying a lot of people was actually a good thing, because the likelihood of the tribe agreeing to vote that person out was high — meaning that she would live to see another day on the beach.</p><p data-characters=80 data-current-count=464 data-injectable=true>Instead, the issue was that Katurah felt disrespected by Bruce and his actions.</p><p data-characters=514 data-current-count=514 data-injectable=true>“I was getting talked down to and barked at and yelled at and ordered and literally being addressed as a child, repeatedly, and that’s just so shocking to me,” she dished. “This is happening to me specifically to a degree that’s different than any other person is getting. Like, this is clearly a Katurah-specific intensity, like there’s a level of rudeness and aggression and harshness towards me specifically that just literally is not being seen with any other person.”</p><p data-characters=210 data-current-count=210 data-injectable=false>To follow this bold statement, the 35-year-old explained why her annoyance with Bruce was at an all time high throughout her Survivor journey, making its way onto our television screens every Wednesday evening.</p><p data-characters=458 data-current-count=668 data-injectable=true>“That feeling of being singled out, it intensifies when you don’t feel like there’s anyone around you that you can just be like ‘You also see this is happening, right?’ It’s like if there was just someone who could also see it or notice it or even honestly just acknowledge that it’s happening, like if I’m just gonna be honest, that’s why episode 5 was so hard for me,” she explained passionately.</p><p data-characters=370 data-current-count=370 data-injectable=false>Within episode 5, Bruce is seen talking down to Katurah, deeming her ideas to be “dumb” and “stupid” on numerous occasions. Also within said episode, Survivor fans see none of the other Lulu tribemates — Jake O’Kane, Kaleb Gebrewold, and Kellie Nalbandian — stand up for her, ultimately causing the New York native to feel singled out.</p><p data-characters=363 data-current-count=733 data-injectable=true>“This was the first episode where I literally had to step away,” Katurah revealed. “I had to take a few days and just emotionally regulate. It just reminded me of being there and that feeling of just being so like, ‘I’ve been getting beat down by this behavior for freaking 10 days now,’ and episode 5 is showing day 10.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Katurah-Survivor-1.png><p data-characters=251 data-current-count=551 data-injectable=true>After explaining Bruce’s power on the Lulu tribe — describing how the control he had over the rest of her tribemates was “literally terrifying” — the Survivor 45 castaway concluded her TikTok video with an overarching statement.</p><p data-characters=474 data-current-count=474 data-injectable=true>“Basically, I say all that to say, I think I figured out why we have so many Katurah-Bruce confessionals, and that’s because my confessionals were my safe space. Everywhere else, I am like putting on a smile and being like, ‘Yeah, everything’s great. Yay.’ I would go to my confessionals and be like, ‘I can just drop everything finally. I can just be honest and say what I’m feeling and what’s happening,'” she spilled.</p><p data-characters=403 data-current-count=403 data-injectable=true>She concluded, “I think I ended up using it a little bit more as a venting space than I realized… that’s what happens when your confessionals are the only space for you to be open and honest about what’s really happening. Your confessional is going to be spicy.” With the mistreatment Katurah was facing from Bruce for 10 days straight, we don’t blame her whatsoever!</p><p data-characters=144 data-current-count=144 data-injectable=false>To see how the rest of Survivor 45 unfolds, catch brand-new episodes&nbsp;of the beloved competition series every Wednesday at 8pm ET/PT on CBS.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yqedaaqmaalZ67qHnDoqqrnaOlsqTAxJ1kq52gmq61scOlsGajkanCs63HZquoqKCoeqKww6ucrKuVqHqnsdSdZLChpJ16o77UnJxmqJWnv6at1KWrZqeeYsC2vtWiraiqXWmCbrXNZphmpp%2BseqWxy56rnpxdqbaswM6kZK%2BhlJq8cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./amd-announces-radeon-r7-260-shipping-midjanuary.html><span>←</span><span>AMD Announces Radeon R7 260; Shipping Mid-January</span></a>
