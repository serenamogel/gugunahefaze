They have to maintain the resonating, heartfelt premise—you don’t have to be related or even the same species to be a family—that is primarily responsible for the previous four flicks grossing an astonishing $2.8 billion worldwide total. But “Collision Course” attempts to solve its sequel fatigue by giving more screen time to side characters from previous chapters and promoting Brit wit <a href=#>Simon Pegg</a>’s hyperactive one-eyed swashbuckling weasel Buck into a breakout status, as he and a trio of nefarious flying dinosaurs escape from the lost world featured in the third “Ice&nbsp;Age” film.</span></p><p>Not only does Buck come bearing an ancient, carved column that holds the key to halting the asteroid, but he pulls a <a href=#>Kate McKinnon</a> here in the weirdness department. The impish Ghostbuster is probably kicking herself that she never thought of toting a pet pumpkin around in a Baby Bjorn or launching into Figaro’s aria from “The Barber of Seville” in a robust performance worthy of pint-size Pavarotti.</p><p>Other distractions that offer varying levels of amusement arrive in the form of goofy opossums Crash and Eddie (<a href=#>Seann William Scott</a> and <a href=#>Josh Peck</a>), the type who giggle when they say the word “duty,” and Sid’s feisty Granny (<a href=#>Wanda Sykes</a>), who is given to such observations as, “That plan is so dumb I wish it had a face so I could smack it!”</p><p>But what appears to be an anything-goes philosophy when it comes to the narrative suddenly takes a turn at the cross section of Incense and Peppermints when we arrive in Geotopia, a hippie-dippy domain of perpetual youth maintained by the presence of magic crystals, which are the key to stopping the asteroid. Probably the weirdest conception is the Shangri Llama (<a href=#>Jesse Tyler Ferguson</a>—apparently, there now is a law that at least one major cast member from “Modern Family” is required to be a voice in every animated film this summer), the spiritual leader of this tribe of yoga enthusiasts who exhibits the spitting prowess of a major league pitcher as he presides over his tribe.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46imp5lkZyybq%2FOpaOiq5mku26vzq6prJ1dZ31ygg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./randy-larson-obituary-death-larson-and-evenson-law-firm-attorney-and-monicas-owner-randy-larson-passes-away.html><span>←</span><span>Randy Larson Obituary Death: Larson and Evenson Law Firm Attorney and Monicas Owner, Randy La</span></a>
