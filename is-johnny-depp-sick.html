The actor went into more detail regarding his injury via his Instagram story at the end of last month.</p><p>“My dear friends, I am sorry to say that I have fractured my ankle, which is a drag. […] several medical professionals have strongly suggested I avoid any and all activity for the moment and so am sadly unable to travel at this time.”</p><p data-characters=399 data-current-count=650 data-injectable=false>After a week of recovery Depp performed with the Hollywood Vampires once again and his fellow bandmate, Alice Cooper, was even able to get the fans to sing happy birthday to the star as the clock struck midnight. It’s safe to say that he’s doing better now considering he is able to perform, and for all of you who were worried you can breathe a sigh of relief as he is most definitely not sick.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S2tHnJqJ%2Bnpqlisaa8z2aqopubZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./escape-room-2.html><span>←</span><span>Escape Room 2 Cast, Actors, Producer, Director, Roles, Salary</span></a>
