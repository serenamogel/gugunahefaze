Ellie and Joel’s arrival on streaming invited a new subset of fans into the Last of Us fold, and saw game sales surge for weeks following the show’s debut. Fresh gamers are finally experiencing the wonder that is The Last of Us, but not every gamer has the means to enjoy the iconic game.</p><h2 id=h-can-i-play-the-last-of-us-on-xbox data-injectable=false>Can I play The Last of Us on Xbox?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/The-Last-of-Us.jpg><p data-characters=432 data-current-count=732 data-injectable=true>More than a decade after it first hit shelves, The Last of Us is still listed among gaming’s must-play titles. Whether or not horror is typically your bag — and whether or not you truly consider The Last of Us a horror title — anyone and everyone should play The Last of Us at least once in this lifetime. Unfortunately for those firmly in the Xbox or bust camp, there is currently no Xbox port for the Naughty Dog staple.</p><p data-characters=579 data-current-count=579 data-injectable=true>Even for those without a PlayStation, however, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">there are options</a>. You can’t enjoy the game on Xbox, but PC gamers finally got their chance to play The Last of Us in early 2023, only to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">have high hopes smashed</a> upon the rocks of a crummy rollout. The game, upon release, was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">too buggy and broken to enjoy</a>, and prompted widespread criticism from PC gamers. In the months since it first came out, the PC version has thankfully been polished up immensely, leaving gamers with a fully playable (and largely bug-free) version of the game to enjoy on their computer or Steam Deck.</p><p data-characters=307 data-current-count=307 data-injectable=false>If you refuse to budge from the Xbox camp, however, you’re out of luck. Its not likely to make the switch anytime soon, given The Last of Us‘ status as a PlayStation staple, but at least you can cry into a few of those Xbox exclusives while the rest of us kill Clickers and break our own hearts.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZooKxlpJ2ybrjArKtmp5ZiwrR5wK%2BYoqSRl7mmec6nZLGan618</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./al-pacino-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Al Pacino Net Worth: Houses &amp;amp; Watches</span></a>
