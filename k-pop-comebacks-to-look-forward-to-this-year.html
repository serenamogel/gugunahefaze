Besides celebrating their eighth anniversary, the album is speculated to be a reflection of their journey since their debut. The girls have already dropped an English pre-released single, “Moonlight Sunrise” to feed their waiting fans before the big drop.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Super M</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=667 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=420 data-current-count=420 data-injectable=true>Nicknamed “The Avengers of K-Pop,” Super M’s return wasn’t foreseen by many. When SM Entertainment announced the group’s comeback on New Year’s Day, it was like a gift to the fans. Not only are they set to return this year, but fans are very excited for NCT’s Lucas to join the group. The comeback also marks the return of EXO’s Baekhyun and SHINee’s Taemin from their mandatory military service.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>G-Dragon</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=451 data-current-count=751 data-injectable=true>Almost six years since he dropped his last album, Kwon Ji Yong, the legendary artist, rapper — and producer G-Dragon — announced that he would be releasing a new album to commemorate his return as a solo musician. The BigBang member, also known as the King of K-Pop, had taken a break to complete his mandatory military service and focus on his modeling career. G-Dragon’s return just might be the most anticipated solo K-pop comeback this year.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>EXO</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=477 data-current-count=777 data-injectable=true>The Powerhouse of K-Pop has finally reunited after Baekhyun, the fifth member to enlist, was discharged from mandatory military service earlier this month. The last time all eight members were together for a performance was back in 2019. Based on the group’s leader Suho’s Instagram update on New Year’s Eve in 2022, EXO just might be back on our radar this year. No date has been announced yet, but fans are expecting a confirmation post from SM Entertainment very soon.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Key (SHINee)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=331 data-current-count=631 data-injectable=true>Following the commercial success of his album Gasoline in 2022, Key announced he would be making a comeback with the repackaged album titled Killer.
