His first album for that company, All I Need to Know (1995), sold well, but his next album,&nbsp;Me and You (1996) sold more than 500,000 copies.

But their union was a short one. The marriage only lasted for about four months, with Renee filing for an annulment in September.</span></p><p><span>When the pair split, Renee cited “fraud” as the reason, which resulted in speculations that he was gay or that he had lied to his former wife about his sexuality. But Renee later clarified that it was “simply legal language and not a reflection of Kenny’s character.”</span></p><p><span>Renee’s citing plagued Kenny for several years, which was put to rest by Kenny himself, stressing that he is not gay.</span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbiz.com/images/celebs/kenny-chesney-and-renee-zellweger.jpg alt="kenny chesney and renee zellweger" width=650 height=964 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span><strong>Kenny Chesney and his ex-wife Renee Zellweger (©: goodhousekeeping.com)</strong></span></p><p><span>The gay rumors were still going around Kenny’s life, and some years later, in an appearance for an interview, Kenny explained that the “fraud” citing was the least harmful one for their marriage annulment, as since other options in the papers didn’t fit well for their relationship.</span></p><p><span>The former lovebirds have never really opened up about their time together but have attributed their split to a ‘miscommunication of the objective of their marriage’ and irreconcilable differences.</span></p><p><span>During their short interval of married life, the former Hollywood couple never had any kids.</span></p><p><span>Several reports have been romantically involved with a few women since calling it quits with Renee, including Miss Tennessee 2005 Amy Colley and ESPN broadcaster Jenn Brown. He was rumored to be dating fellow country star Miranda Lambert before she married her now-ex-husband, Blake Shelton, in 2011.</span></p><p><span>As of now, Kenny has been romantically linked with Mary Nolan. They have been together since the year 2012 though the pair remains extremely private about their relationship.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Kenny Chesney Intriguing Dating History</strong></span></h2><p><span>After the gay rumors surfaced in Kenny’s life, he repeatedly denied it. As per accessonline.com, in later years, Chesney told <a href=# rel=noopener>Playboy magazine</a> of his reaction to the rumors:</span></p><p><span><strong>"What guy who loves girls wouldn’t be angry about that? I didn’t sign up for that. I'm&nbsp;</strong><strong>pretty confident in the fact that I love girls. I’ve got a long line of girls who could testify that I’m not gay.&nbsp;</strong></span><span><strong>There were years when I had a better summer than A-Rod&nbsp;</strong><strong>over 100 women. My first five years on the read were intense because I was the guy in college who never got laid until I started playing guitar."</strong></span></p><p><span>After going through his divorce, Kenny got himself a new girlfriend, Amy Colley. The two were often spotted several times, vacationing on the clear beaches of Malibu and the Bahamas. However, their relationship started to crumble when Chesney spotted another woman in Cancun, Jenn Brown. This led to his split with Amy after two years of dating her.</span></p><p><span>Rumors also spread once Chesney was dating Miranda Lambert, but it became a folk tale.</span></p><p><span>Since the year 2012, Kenny is in a happy relationship with Mary Nolan. In a couple of awards ceremonies, Nolan has been seen beside Chesney, such as the CMA Awards and the Country Countdown Awards.</span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbiz.com/images/celebs/kenny-chesney-and-mary-nolan.jpg alt="kenny chesney and mary nolan" width=650 height=850 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span><strong>Kenny Chesney and Mary Nolan (©: Pinterest)</strong></span></p><p><span>She was also seen kissing Kenny on the cheeks after the country singer has received the Pinnacle Award. </span><span>Chesney and Nolan were recently seen in April of 2021 at the ACM Awards.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6CzZpOkunCvxKWcm6qZqbamv46knKemqWKwqbHSp5yyZaSkwrN5w5qrnqtdo7K1edaoqa2gXaKus77InptmnJGptq%2Bz</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brad-stevens.html><span>←</span><span>Brad Stevens- Wiki, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Ethnicity (Biographygist)</span></a>
