But her return in April 2024 is as a headliner at the famed Coachella music festival that spans two weekends. The 38-year-old “A&W” singer first performed at the fest a decade ago then later wrote the song “Coachella - Woodstock in My Mind” after attending as a fan.

Del Rey released her ninth studio album, Did You Know That There’s a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd, in March 2023. Her new album, Lasso, is expected this September.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 title="Quick Facts" data-anchor-id=quick-facts class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Quick Facts</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="body-tip css-i9osfz e1k3dme10">FULL NAME: Elizabeth Woolridge Grant<br>BORN: June 21, 1985<br>BIRTHPLACE: New York, New York<br>ASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Cancer</p><h2 data-node-id=9 title="Where Is Lana Del Rey From?" data-anchor-id=where-is-lana-del-rey-from class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Where Is Lana Del Rey From?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Lana Del Rey was born as Elizabeth Woolridge Grant on June 21, 1985, in New York City. Her parents were working in advertising when she was born but left their city life behind to move to Lake Placid, New York, in the Adirondack Mountains when Del Rey was a baby.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">She grew up with a younger brother and sister. Her sister, photographer Caroline “Chuck” Grant, shot Del Rey’s Lust for Life album cover and has taken promotional photos of the musician.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As a teenager in the small community of Lake Placid, Del Rey started drinking heavily. She’d attended Catholic school, but her parents sent her to Kent School, a boarding school in Connecticut, because of her drinking. Boarding school wasn’t a complete cure, but by the age of 18, Del Rey was sober.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Instead of attending college right away, she went to live with her aunt and uncle on Long Island; her uncle taught her to play guitar. Although Del Rey soon enrolled at Fordham University in the Bronx, where she studied philosophy, music became her true focus.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 title="Becoming Lana Del Rey" data-anchor-id=becoming-lana-del-rey class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Becoming Lana Del Rey</h2><img alt="lana del ray sings into a microphone she holds in one hand, she stands on a stage and has her other hand in front of her, she wears a gold shimmering shirt with white cuffs and collar" title="Lana Del Ray performs in November 2011" width=3457 height=2301 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/american-singer-lana-del-rey-performs-on-stage-at-scala-on-news-photo-1712966830.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Lana Del Rey performs in London in November 2011.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Del Rey, then still known as Lizzy Grant, started her career with open mic nights and club gigs. In 2006, she entered a songwriting competition; she didn’t win, but a judge on the panel helped her create a demo, which led to her signing with the indie label 5 Points. With the $10,000 she earned for this deal, Del Rey moved into a New Jersey trailer park.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“The way things started off for me in the way I was portrayed was that I was feigning emotional sensitivity.

She flirted with names like Sparkle Rope Jump Queen and May Jailer before settling on Lana Del Rey, which was selected on a trip to Miami in part for its evocation of coastal glamor. “Lana Del Rey just sounded good coming out of my mouth—it was exotic sounding, and I like exotic places and I like really gorgeous things,” she later <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/11702/1/lana-del-rey-bad-girl-blues data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="told Dazed" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">told Dazed</a>. “I could build a sonic world towards the way the name fell off my lips. It’s helped me a lot.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Del Rey created a signature sound of vulnerable, emotional alternative music that often incorporates nostalgia for America’s past. Her aesthetic typically pairs American iconography with darker perspectives, something <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/11702/1/lana-del-rey-bad-girl-blues data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="she dubbed" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">she dubbed</a> “Hollywood Sadcore” early on. To match her new name, she dyed her blonde hair and adopted a more retro, glamorized image. One of her managers described her as “gangster <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/nancy-sinatra data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Nancy Sinatra" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Nancy Sinatra</a>.”</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Read Her Biography</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Around this time, she left her record label behind and briefly lived in London, where she focused on songwriting with the likes of Justin Parker, among others. They collaborated on her song “Video Games,” which Del Rey released on YouTube with a music video she produced once she was back in the United States. It became a viral hit and finally paved the way for her mainstream success.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The news that Del Rey had signed with Interscope Records in October 2011 made some people wonder if “Video Games,” released earlier that summer, was a marketing ploy and not a video she’d created herself. There was also speculation that her father was a millionaire who’d bankrolled her (Del Rey has said her family was never wealthy).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2012, Del Rey appeared on Saturday Night Live and was criticized for looking nervous and singing hesitantly. That same year, reviewers panned her first studio album, Born to Die, and her sound. “I think in one week, The New Yorker, The New York Times, The New York Post, and New York magazine agreed that it was the most ridiculous act that had ever come out,” the singer <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/art-books-music/a45862475/lana-del-rey-interview-2023/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="told Harper’s Bazaar" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">told Harper’s Bazaar</a> in 2023. Instead of stopping her, the critiques inspired Del Rey to continue to create. Besides, fans loved Born To Die and propelled it into the Top 5 on the Billboard 200 album chart. Del Rey’s successful career was off and running.</p><h2 data-node-id=25 title=Albums data-anchor-id=albums class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Albums</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">To date, Dey Rey has released nine albums, including one under her real name Lizzy Grant, and one EP. Born To Die from 2012 is often credited as her debut, as this was the first to carry her professional name. The musician’s first album overall actually dates back to 2010’s Lana Del Ray AKA Lizzy Grant.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In February 2024, Dey Rey announced an upcoming new album.

It came out in 2010 while she was signed with 5 Points Records, but the digital release was only available for a couple of months. She later got back the rights to her first album so as to avoid confusion with her assumed moniker.</p><h3 class="css-18tq7ug e2odqo15"><span class="css-jlx6sx e2odqo12"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.biography.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt width=100% height=auto decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Born To Die</p></h3><p class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Del Rey’s first major-label album was Born To Die, which came out in 2012. Although critics didn’t embrace the album, it reached No. 2 on the Billboard 200, has sold more than 7 million copies worldwide, and has been certified platinum five times. It remains her best-selling album to date and includes one of her most popular songs “Summertime Sadness.”</p><h3 class="css-18tq7ug e2odqo15"><span class="css-jlx6sx e2odqo12"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.biography.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt width=100% height=auto decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Paradise</p></h3><p class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The year 2012 also saw the arrival of Dey Rey’s EP Paradise, which contained the songs “Ride” and “Cola.” The 8-track collection earned the singer a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album.</p><h3 class="css-18tq7ug e2odqo15"><span class="css-jlx6sx e2odqo12"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.biography.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt width=100% height=auto decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Ultraviolence</p></h3><p class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Ultraviolence, from 2014, featured atmospheric ballads like “Pretty When You Cry,” “Sad Girl,” and “West Coast.” It debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and became platinum-certified in November 2021. Before its release, Del Rey redid the completed album with producer Dan Auerbach, using single takes and cheap microphones instead of professional equipment.</p><h3 class="css-18tq7ug e2odqo15"><span class="css-jlx6sx e2odqo12"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.biography.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt width=100% height=auto decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Honeymoon</p></h3><p class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Del Rey has described her dark, critically praised 2015 album, Honeymoon, as “a tribute to Los Angeles.” She moved to California in 2012 and says it’s a place where she’s found more musical collaborators than in New York. It reached No. 2 on the Billboard 200 and landed at No. 1 in countries like Australia and Ireland.</p><h3 class="css-18tq7ug e2odqo15"><span class="css-jlx6sx e2odqo12"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.biography.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt width=100% height=auto decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Lust For Life</p></h3><p class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2017, Del Rey released Lust For Life. Although there are still dark tunes on the album, songs like “Love” gave it a more upbeat tone than earlier Del Rey projects, while tracks like “Coachella - Woodstock in My Mind” took the day’s politics into account. It’s also the first Del Rey album with guest artists, including <a href=# class="css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">The Weeknd</a>&nbsp;on “Lust for Life,” <a href=# class="css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Stevie Nicks</a> on “Beautiful People Beautiful Problems,” and <a href=# class="css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Sean Ono Lennon</a> on “Tomorrow Never Came.” The album reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200.</p><h3 class="css-18tq7ug e2odqo15"><span class="css-jlx6sx e2odqo12"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.biography.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt width=100% height=auto decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Norman F––g Rockwell</p></h3><p class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In September 2018, Del Rey released two singles from her forthcoming sixth studio album, the pensive “Mariners Apartment Complex” and more expansive “Venice Bitch.” She followed in January 2019 with “Hope Is a Dangerous Thing for a Woman Like Me to Have – but I Have It,” originally named after troubled American poet <a href=# class="css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Sylvia Plath</a>, before dropping a dreamy cover of Sublime’s “Doing Time” in May.</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The album, Norman F––g Rockwell arrived at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 following its August 2019 debut, with “The Greatest” and the title track also earning releases as singles before the end of the year. Del Rey <a href=# class="css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">described the album to Billboard</a> as, “A folk record with a little surf twist.” Both the album and its title track earned Grammy nominations for Album and Song of the Year.</p><h3 class="css-18tq7ug e2odqo15" readability=-4><span class="css-jlx6sx e2odqo12"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.biography.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt width=100% height=auto decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Chemtrails Over the Country Club</p></h3><p class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Del Rey released the single “Let Me Love You Like A Woman” from her seventh studio album, Chemtrails Over the Country Club, in October 2020. “I’ve been really stressed about this album,” the musician <a href=# class="css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">shared with Interview</a> before its March 2021 release. “From the top, we knew what Norman was. But with Chemtrails, it was like, ‘Is this new folk? Oh, god, are we going country?’ Now that it’s done I feel really good about it, and I think a defining moment for this album will be ‘White Dress/Waitress.’” Later renamed simply “White Dress,” that song opened the album, which debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200. Chemtrails also included a cover of <a href=# class="css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Joni Mitchell</a>’s song “For Free.”</p><h3 class="css-18tq7ug e2odqo15"><span class="css-jlx6sx e2odqo12"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.biography.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt width=100% height=auto decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Blue Banisters</p></h3><p class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Just seven months after Chemtrails Over the Country Club, Del Rey was back with her eighth studio album, Blue Banisters. The October 2021 release didn’t fare quite as well as her previous albums, peaking at No. 8 on the Billboard 200. However, it became her sixth album to top Billboard’s Alternative Albums chart, setting a new record. (The musician had previously been tied with the Foo Fighters and Coldplay.)</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“Blue Banisters was more of an explanatory album, more of a defensive album, which is why I didn’t promote it, period, at all,” Del Rey&nbsp;<a href=# class="css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">shared with Rolling Stone UK</a> in a 2023 article. “I didn’t want anyone to listen to it. I just wanted it to be there in case anyone was ever curious for any information.”</p><h3 class="css-18tq7ug e2odqo15" readability=-4><span class="css-jlx6sx e2odqo12"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.biography.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt width=100% height=auto decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Did You Know That There’s a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd</p></h3><p class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Did You Know That There’s a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd released in March 2023. It peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 and extended her No. 1 alternative albums to seven. “Family of origin is the overall theme,” Del Rey <a href=# class="css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">told Billboard</a>. “I think with Blue Banisters I wanted to capture this idea, too, but I flew it under the radar. I was trying to address some criticisms that I had heard said after Chemtrails… mostly that people don’t know much about me.

Her house has been broken into, and in 2012, her computer was hacked, exposing personal information and unreleased songs, many of which spread online. In February 2018, a man was arrested at a concert in Orlando, Florida, for plotting to kidnap the singer.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=58 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Del Rey has also courted her own controversies, starting with a 2014 interview with The Guardian in 2014. “I wish I was dead already,” she said after talking about the late musicians <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/kurt-cobain data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Kurt Cobain" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Kurt Cobain</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/amy-winehouse data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Amy Winehouse" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Amy Winehouse</a>. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/celebrities/frances-bean-cobain data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Cobain’s daughter, Frances" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Cobain’s daughter, Frances</a>, criticized her for the remark.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=59 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Sometimes her songs have touched on sensitive topics and hot-button political issues. Del Rey’s 2014 song “Ultraviolence” featured the controversial line “He hit me and it felt like a kiss.” Three years later, Del Rey said she’s no longer comfortable with the lyric. In 2019, she earned attention for the August release of “Looking for America,” with lyrics like “I’m still looking for my own version of America/One without the gun, where the flag can freely fly” inspired by recent mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio. Del Rey’s track “Judah Smith Interlude” on her 2023 album caught flack from some fans over her inclusion of megachurch pastor Judah Smith’s sermon.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=60 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In early 2018, news broke that Radiohead asked for some of the publishing rights to Del Rey’s “Get Free” due to similarities to their hit song “Creep.” During a performance that March, the singer said her and the band’s dispute had been resolved.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=61 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Del Rey has come under fire more than once over matters of race and representation.
