While we can’t make it to every game we can certainly party for each and every one!You can’t have a football party without delicious food and that’s where I come in. We are pretty much always the ones hosting parties {of all sorts} and football parties are one of my very favorite types. You wanna know why? Because there is just no limit to the different food and fun you can have at a football party!</p><img data-perfmatters-preload decoding=async title="A Football Field Cake is the perfect way to celebrate football all season long! | MomOnTimeout.com #recipe #football #cake" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.momontimeout.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/NFL-Kickoff-Party-and-Football-Field-Cake.jpg alt="A Football Field Cake is the perfect way to celebrate football all season long! | MomOnTimeout.com #recipe #football #cake" width=600 height=399 border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>I picked up an undecodrated 1/2 sheet cake to give myself a head start. This year I made a pledge to myself to enjoy my parties more and one of the ways I’ve done that is by taking short cuts when I can. I think parties are supposed to be enjoyed by everyone – including the hostess! I had never done this before and I was suprised at how easy it was. I simply scraped off all the frosting from the cake and put it in a bowl. I added in the food color {and of course I couldn’t find my green so I used blue and yellow…} and mixed it up.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.momontimeout.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Cake-Prep-SnickersMinis.jpg alt width=600 border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>After getting the frosting the green that I wanted, I spread it on the cake. I used green sugar sprinkles for the center of the cake to make it look like grass and used whole snickers bars for the benches.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.momontimeout.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Football-Field-SnickersMinis.jpg alt width=600 border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><h5>free email course</h5><h4><strong>5 SECRETS</strong> TO GETTING DINNER ON THE TABLE...<strong>FAST!</strong></h4></p><p>I used white frosting to outline the field and the yard lines. I used red and blue sparkly gel to create the end zones. Red for the the 49ers and blue for the Lions. {Go 49ers!!!} &nbsp;Finally, I used Snickers Minis to create football offensive and defensive formations on the field. I used the red and blue gel again for the x’s and o’s. I love it!</p><img decoding=async title="A Football Field Cake is the perfect way to celebrate football all season long! | MomOnTimeout.com #recipe #football #cake" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.momontimeout.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Football-Formation-Cake-SnickersMinis.jpg alt="A Football Field Cake is the perfect way to celebrate football all season long! | MomOnTimeout.com #recipe #football #cake" width=600 height=497 border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>I added a few more finishing touches including goal posts made from straws and pipe cleaner and the boys located the correct teams from the Snickers Minis bags to put in the end zones.</p><p><img decoding=async title="A Football Field Cake is the perfect way to celebrate football all season long! | MomOnTimeout.com #recipe #football #cake" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.momontimeout.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/NFL-Kickoff-Party-and-Football-Field-Cake-1.jpg alt="A Football Field Cake is the perfect way to celebrate football all season long! | MomOnTimeout.com #recipe #football #cake" width=600 height=401 border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>You &nbsp;might be wondering how they found those two particular candies…here’s how:</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.momontimeout.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/NFL-Kickoff-Party-and-Football-Field-Cake-2.jpg alt width=600 border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>They collected every cup they could find and proceeded to sort the Snickers NFL minis by team. We were surprised to hear that the Dolphins are Reece’s favorite team and also that there are “kid” teams and “grown-up” teams. Didn’t know that did you? Let me explain how that works {according to Reece} – if the mascot appears kid-friendly, i.e. Dolphins, Lions, or if the packaging contained recognizable letters – it went to the kid pile. The grown-ups got basically everything else 😉</p><p><img decoding=async title="A Football Field Cake is the perfect way to celebrate football all season long! | MomOnTimeout.com #recipe #football #cake" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.momontimeout.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/NFL-Kickoff-Party-and-Football-Field-Cake-3.jpg alt="A Football Field Cake is the perfect way to celebrate football all season long! | MomOnTimeout.com #recipe #football #cake" width=600 height=400 border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>This cake was definitely the centerpiece of the table and got lots of oohs and aahs as people walked in.
