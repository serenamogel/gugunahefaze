Oliva Colman is a queen. That much we’ve all known for years, not least because she’s played a number of queens brilliantly in the past (if you haven’t watched 2018’s The Favourite, what are you waiting for?!). Marvel convincing her to join the MCU for Secret Invasion has to be a special kind of win for the franchise, and her character on the show is one of the very best things about it.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Cecily Strong Net Worth 2024</h2><time>Jul 20, 2024</time>

While lightning is known not to strike the same place twice, Tom Hanks would refute the saying, seeing as both his wives have dealt with cancer. One with bone cancer and the other with breast cancer.
His first wife, Susan Dillingham, who he married in 1979, was diagnosed with bone cancer in 2001, and a year later, she succumbed to the illness.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Caitlin O'Heaney movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</h2><time>Jul 19, 2024</time>

When we mention food and celebrities, you may picture your favorite Food Network personalities or competitive YouTube eaters. You might even think about Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson and his massive cheat day meals. While Andy Samberg might not come to mind, perhaps he should because the star helped to create a burger that was named after him.
