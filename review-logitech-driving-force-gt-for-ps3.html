I lifted it out of the box, it felt almost weightless, so I thought “This can’t be good, it’ll end up broken in no time”. I was wrong, it’s surprisingly durable.&nbsp; Finally, I removed all the contents and placed them on the table, It comes with the actual steer wheel, pedals, and some cords (a plug, and a USB&nbsp;adapter to plug into your PS3).</p><p style=text-align:center data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/driving-force-gt-2.jpg alt width=430 height=320 sizes="(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p data-characters=595 data-current-count=595 data-injectable=true>The steering wheel attaches to your table via two monkey wrench type hook that are to be screwed from two areas in the top.&nbsp;Now upon plugging the GT into my PS3, it immediately buzzed to life spinning in one direction, then the other, and centering. I put in Gran <span><span>Turismo</span></span> 5 Prologue and sat down gripping the wheel. The material is comfortable, and doesn’t make your hands sweat. The pedals are also comfortable, and they won’t slide across the floor if you apply a lot of pressure. There is a dial allegedly used for brake tension, which I know nothing about so I left it alone.</p><p data-characters=587 data-current-count=587 data-injectable=true>As the countdown for the race to begin started, I pressed down on the acceleration pedal and felt exhilarated as vibrations ran up my arms. The race began and I was off like a rocket, even the slightest movement of the wheel seems to transfer into the game. Upon the first turn, I nonchalantly turned the wheel thinking I could clear the turn with ease, this was not the case. I went sliding into the sand as I fought to keep the steering wheel in place, the feeling was pure ecstasy. The counter balancing of the GT makes it feel like you’re seriously sliding across those roads.</p><p data-characters=460 data-current-count=460 data-injectable=true>The GT, brings new meaning to all your favorite PS3 racing games, it really, makes you feel like you’re in the driver’s seat. Being a bit curious, I plugged in my old PS2 , put in Gran <span><span>Turismo</span></span> 4, and the steering wheel worked! I played all my older racing games with new vigor, things like Need for Speed Underground, became completely different games. I found out the wheel also works with your computer as well, <span><span>that’s</span></span> also a huge plus.</p><p data-characters=477 data-current-count=477 data-injectable=true>I would recommend this to anyone who wants a console steering wheel, it’s almost perfect in every way. The only real downsides are the fact it isn’t cordless like most things are these days, but, that doesn’t come into much account. Also, if you have all your consoles in one room, you’re usually fighting to find plug space, and the GT comes with a rather large bulky plug. With all things in consideration, I’d definitely recommend this godsend.</p><ul data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZoqZ6umZrEbrjOoKCtnZOdeqW%2ByK%2Bgp59dm7yzr8Rmnq1llqS%2FbrzSbGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hunter-s-thompson.html><span>←</span><span>Hunter S.
