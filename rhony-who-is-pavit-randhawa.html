Names such as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Abraham Lichy</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">David Craig</a>, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cass Bird</a> have been turning heads since the premiere of season 14, and the latest to join the party is Pavit Randhawa. By now, most RHONY fans are surely aware that he’s Jessel Taank’s husband, but what else is there to know about him?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-is-pavit-randhawa data-injectable=false>Who is Pavit Randhawa?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Jessel Taank (@jesseltaank)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=315 data-current-count=615 data-injectable=true>As tends to happen with the family members of reality stars, there’s not as much information to be found online about Pavit Singh Randhawa as there is of his wife. Their lives are pretty much intertwined at this point, so we know far more about their path as a couple than about this hubby’s life prior.</p><p data-characters=334 data-current-count=334 data-injectable=false>What we do know, however, is that Randhawa is a financier based in Los Angeles, U.S. According to his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">LinkedIn profile</a>, Randhawa graduated from the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business with a Master of Business Administration degree, and from the University of California, Los Angeles with a Bachelor of Arts degree.</p><p data-characters=354 data-current-count=688 data-injectable=true>The businessman met Jessel Taank through a mutual friend, who introduced the two at a bar, and for some years, they maintained a long-distance connection. It wasn’t until Randhawa decided to move to the Big Apple that things got serious, though, as the pair became roommates mostly out of convenience, Taank revealed in a 2016 interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vogue</a>.</p><p data-characters=516 data-current-count=516 data-injectable=true>Randhawa and Taank became engaged after three years of dating, and eventually tied the knot in Mexico. Now, the couple has two twin sons, but the journey to get here was not an easy one for the couple. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Taank</a>, the pair had a lot of difficulties conceiving, a process that took almost four years and took a great emotional toll on both, but especially her. Luckily, everything turned out fine for Taank and Randhawa, as the two are currently still married, and with the family they have always wished for.</p><p data-characters=129 data-current-count=129 data-injectable=false>To follow their lives even more closely, make sure not to miss any new episodes of The Real Housewives of New York City on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yztM6nsGavmKR6qr%2BMqZivoaRiv6K6w6GYsJlf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nikki-mudarris.html><span>←</span><span>Nikki Mudarris Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</span></a>
