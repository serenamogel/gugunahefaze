The Impeachment: American Crime Story actress donned a bespoke Louis Vuitton two-piece ensemble to the 74th Emmy Awards ceremony with her girlfriend, Holland Taylor.&nbsp;Although the costume was similar to the style seen earlier in the Louis Vuitton resort 2023 collection, people were dissatisfied with Sarah Paulson’s strong appearance and criticized her clothing choice. On Twitter, @meralee727 expressed her view, writing:</p><p>“How come Sarah Paulson is dressed in a nice napkin as a top?”</p><p>Many admirers, including @meralee727, commented on the actress’ dress at the 2022 Emmy Awards.</p><h2>Fans’ responses to Sarah Paulson’s Louis Vuitton 2-piece ensemble on the red carpet at the 2022 Emmys</h2><p>This year was the 47-year-old actress’ ninth Emmy nomination, so she arrived in a way that only a veteran could. Sarah Paulson stole the show in an attention-grabbing Louis Vuitton ensemble designed by Karla Welch.&nbsp;Many people and fans of the actress criticized the navy blue two-piece structured set, prompting them to create hilarious memes on Twitter. The square structured top was likened to a navy blue purse by admirer @seanlofficial. Other admirers linked Sarah Paulson to fictitious characters such as Woody from Toy Story and Precog from the American science fiction film Minority Report, which aired in 2002.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Sarah-Paulson-3.jpg alt="Sarah Paulson" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Fans have likened her to America’s Next Top Model cycle 11 winner Marjorie Conrad, British actress Claire Foy, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Tilda Swinton. Twitter users, as usual, had something to say about Paulson’s attire, whether positive or negative; nonetheless, it cannot erase the fact that her costume turned heads and provided her a powerful presence on the red carpet.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Sarah Paulson doesn’t need a handbag she IS the handbag <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#Emmys2022</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#emmys</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/gPHhAiJCTR</a></p><p>— SΞAN (@Seanlofficial) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">September 12, 2022</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Sarah Paulson’s look tonight on the <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#Emmys</a> reminded me so much of Marjorie from ANTM Cycle 11. <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/FvjVYrLZr9</a></p><p>— Camm .

The crop top was structured and square in design. The crop top has no sleeves and a cape design.&nbsp;Karla Welch styled the ensemble’s bottom, which had Paulson wearing a ruched skirt in a similar dark blue tone with a boxy collared top. The tiered pleated skirt had a peplum at the waist and flowed down towards the ground. The skirt was fastened with a studded black belt with silver rhinestones at the waist, which was also seen on the Louis Vuitton resort runway in 2023.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Sarah-Paulson-1.jpg alt="Sarah Paulson" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The actress accented her monochrome outfit with a silver necklace and a huge glittering ring on her right hand. Sarah’s short brunette hair was gelled down and split to the side to complement her dress. With a touch of black mascara, light pink blush, and an orange-red splash of color on her lips, her makeup was kept basic.&nbsp;She appeared alongside her lifelong companion, Holland Taylor, who is now 79 years old. The couple started dating in 2015.&nbsp;Paulson was nominated for an Emmy this year for Lead Actress in a Limited Series for her performance in the popular program Impeachment: American Crime Story, but she did not win.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Actress</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Sarah Paulson</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiqmqqRnXqxrdSlqqimXZy8tXnCq6CtoZOex6awjJ%2Bmq2WYmr9usNGeqqxlpaV6rbvOpGSopl2ptaZ5xKaksqtdp7KlecKaqamdpGJ%2FcX6RaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-chucky-in-dead-by-daylight-the-games-newest-killer-explained.html><span>←</span><span>Is Chucky in Dead by Daylight?
