The shorts have an eight-inch inseam and two side pockets big enough to hold your smartphone while you're out for a hot girl walk, or your card and keys while running errands. They're available in a completely ​​opaque shade of black, meaning you can totally pull a Gigi Hadid and wear them on your coffee run without any wardrobe mishaps.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The brand says the shorts will fit and feel just like their sister leggings, which have a major stretch factor thanks to that touch of spandex that numerous reviewers say they are especially enamored with. <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">One shopper confirmed</a> the leggings fit in the most "flattering way," despite their initial sizing concerns, and dubbed the leggings "without exaggeration…the most comfortable item of clothing I've ever put on my body." <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Another added</a> that they "fit like a glove" and are so soft and comfortable that they're going back and buying more.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Stocking up on several pairs in this fabric seems to be a trend among reviewers, so don't be shocked if you too fall super in love with your new shorts. The "<a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">incredibly soft</a>" material led one reviewer to order five more, while another "<a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">immediately</a>" reordered "multiple pairs" after trying them on.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Get a feel for this "incredible" fabric for yourself in a shorter length with pockets by ordering the new <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Satina Bike Shorts</a> from Amazon today.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3y0rdOipZplkp64pnnSoaarrKNixKrAx2anqJubmsG0ecCmmLOnng%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-alicia-machado-winner-of-la-casa-de-los-famosos.html><span>←</span><span> Who is Alicia Machado, winner of La Casa De Los Famosos?
