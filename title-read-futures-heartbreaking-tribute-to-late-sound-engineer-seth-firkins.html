First thing came to my mind is, why are you sleep at 5am? That’s when we record our best shit & I tell u ‘don’t’ fall asleep we got more work to do.. but somethin told me I should’ve been at home recording for some reason.”</p><p>“I was saying this in my head, then bad news beat me home!

No kap in my game kid, rest well my brother. Rest well.”</p><p>Future wasn’t the only one to pay his respects to Firkins, who passed away the age of 36.
