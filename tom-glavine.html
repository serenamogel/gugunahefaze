His pitching coach suggested that he hum a tune while he pitched to help him breathe more naturally. Glavine started humming “Mary Had a Little Lamb” and found that it worked. He continued to hum the tune throughout his career, even during his Cy Young Award-winning seasons.</p><p>In 2002, Glavine was pitching for the New York Mets and had just given up a home run to Chipper Jones of the Atlanta Braves. After the game, Glavine’s young son Mason was upset that his dad had given up the home run. Glavine told him, “Don’t worry, I’ll get him next time.” The next time Glavine faced Jones, he struck him out on three pitches, and Mason was thrilled.</p><p>Glavine was known for his meticulous preparation and attention to detail. Before each start, he would watch video of his opponents and study their tendencies. He would also meticulously plan out his pitching sequence and work with his catcher to make sure they were on the same page. This preparation helped Glavine become one of the most successful and consistent pitchers of his era.</p><p>During Game 6 of the 1995 World Series, Glavine famously told catcher Javy Lopez that he was going to throw the first pitch of the game inside to Cleveland Indians leadoff hitter Kenny Lofton. Lopez called for a fastball, and Glavine threw it right where he wanted to, striking Lofton out looking. That pitch set the tone for the rest of the game, as Glavine went on to pitch a complete game shutout, giving the Braves their first World Series championship.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-922 data-method=placement-service></span><h2>Tom Glavine Quotes</h2><p>“Pitching is a game of repetition, and the more you do it, the better you become at it.”</p><p>“I always tell young players that they should enjoy the moment and not worry too much about the future.”</p><p>“When you’re young, you think that you’re going to pitch forever.”</p><p>“The great thing about baseball is that it’s a team sport, and you have to rely on your teammates to be successful.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_10"></span><h2><span id=Frequently_Asked_Questions_About_XYZ_H2_and_Centered>Frequently Asked Questions About </span>Tom Glavine</h2><strong class=schema-faq-question>Who is Tom Glavine?</strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>Tom Glavine is a famous American former professional baseball pitcher born in Concord, Massachusetts, United States.
