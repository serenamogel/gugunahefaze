For example, Apex Legends‘ Respawn Entertainment is at least trying to monitor stream sniping and ban anyone caught doing it. The problem is that it’s not modifying the game in any way, so is difficult to outright prevent.</p><p data-characters=108 data-current-count=505 data-injectable=false>Here’s hoping Nick doesn’t give up on Fortnite, though, he’s one of the best for a reason.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZoraKqkaF6p7vRraWirJVisLOxwK2mq2Wjlsa0edKnoKmdoqh6qa3VnmSrrZmjsqV5x6KqZpmSnrmqwNhmq6hlo6m%2Fpq3MaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./in-dubious-battle-2017.html><span>←</span><span>In Dubious Battle movie review (2017)</span></a>
