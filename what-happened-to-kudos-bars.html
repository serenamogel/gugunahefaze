Well, the folks at Mars once tried to make that dream come true when they rolled out the legendary Kudos Bar in 1986. Marketed as a nutritious granola snack with a robust candy flavor and a thick chocolate coating, the product was wildly successful throughout the ‘90s. But what the heck happened to these wonder bars? Sadly, like the dinosaurs, Kudos Bars are a thing of the past. But, unlike dinosaurs, there are no plans to resurrect them. So, what happened? Let’s explore the snack’s rich (and if you had a chance to taste them, you know I do mean rich) history, shall we?&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-are-kudos-granola-bars><strong>What are Kudos granola bars?</strong></h2><p>Originally available in three flavors (Nutty Fudge, Chocolate Chip, and Peanut Butter), Kudos’ bars were basically chocolate covered granola bars. They fit right in with the other sweet snacks masquerading as health foods such as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">SnackWells</a>. After a brief hiatus in the early aughts, Kudos was reintroduced in 2011 with an updated appearance: The classic milk chocolate coating on the bars was removed and replaced with a chocolate base and chocolate drizzle on top. Kudos’ updated design made it appear more like a granola bar than a candy bar, in an effort to boost the appearance of a healthy snack.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-did-kudos-bars-have-m-ms><strong>Did Kudos bars have M&Ms?</strong></h2><p>Oh, absolutely! Along with the flagship trio of Nutty Fudge, Chocolate Chip, and Peanut Butter, Kudos also collaborated with brands like M&Ms, Snickers, Dove Milk Chocolate to create “granola bars” that were definitely not “candy bars.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-why-were-kudos-bars-discontinued><strong>Why were Kudos bars discontinued?</strong></h2><p>In a fateful 2017 Facebook response to an unhappy customer who was complaining that they couldn’t find Kudos anywhere, the Mars company stated that Kudos were officially discontinued. The company never offered a formal statement explaining why they took Kudos off the market. Some speculate that it was simply the end of an era and people weren’t falling for the old healthy candy bar trick anymore. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">One Reddit user</a> firmly put the blame on “your mom.”&nbsp;</p><p>So, though it’s unfortunate that these heralded snacks are no longer available to us consumers, you can rest easy in the knowledge that they weren’t quite so healthy anyways. And, if you really want to get a sense of what a Kudos bar was like, simply dip a Nature Valley bar into a vat of melted chocolate and say to yourself, “My my my, what nutritious decisions I’m making!” All jokes aside, just <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">enjoy a candy bar</a> with pride! No need to put on airs! We’re with you!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaK%2BYlsFutMCpp56mlZl6tbuMpKydp6Nir6K%2B0mg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tagliatelle.html><span>←</span><span>Tagliatelle with Asparagus &amp;amp; Peas</span></a>
