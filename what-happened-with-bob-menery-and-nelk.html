Though, NELK’s Kyle Forgeard has now disputed that.</p><p>A few days after Menery released his popular TikTok, Forgeard used Instagram stories to explain his side of the story. He claimed that Menery had received almost $1.2 million in compensation for his efforts.</p><p>“Bob claims that we owe him money on social media. That is false. We owe Bob Menery nothing,” the YouTube user said.</p><p>He also claims that the contract was horrible for the podcast. However, over the 10 months he appeared on the programme, he earned $1.2 million. $1.2 million in 10 months.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmJa7orLUqGWcp51kxKmt02afmqigmrumsIywoK2gXZe8o3nMnqWeqqlirq%2BwjKecpaNf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tom-hiddleston.html><span>←</span><span>Tom Hiddleston movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</span></a>
