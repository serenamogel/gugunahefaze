Appropriately deemed The Samberger, <a href=#>People</a>&nbsp;explains that the comedian's Chicago-style hot dog-inspired burger&nbsp;features "a beef patty topped with spicy sport peppers, roasted tomatoes, chopped dill pickles, relish made out of kombu (an edible kelp), roasted garlic aioli, poppy seeds, and yellow mustard."&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>"I worked tirelessly 'munchin around' with the Umami Burger team to design a burger that would best represent everything I stand for," Samberg shared, per <a href=#>EW</a>. Saying that they "tried many combinations and flavors, and ultimately landed on a Chicago Dog-themed burger," he noted, "[It] has literally nothing to do with me. But it tasted really good so we went with it."</p><p>Costing $13, the aforementioned outlets pointed out that $1 of that was going to be donated to the <a href=#>Center for Early Intervention of Deafness</a>. Although when <a href=#>Umami Burger brought some for the cast of "Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"</a> they probably let the actors have the food for free.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbWxkboR1e9ahmK1lnaTAtXnPnqappJVisbC602aip6enYq6ju9StZJqmlK56tK3Mm5yrn18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./diy-drawer-organizer.html><span>←</span><span>DIY Drawer Organizer #ScotchEXP - Mom On Timeout</span></a>
