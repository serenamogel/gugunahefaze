I’ve worked up a list of personality traits associated with each type on the basis of the trainers of that type, along with the playstyles of the Pokémon themselves (easier said than done when two trainers of the same type can have wildly different personas!).<p>Let us know:<br></p><ul><li data-xf-list-type=ul>Which type(s) are you?</li><li data-xf-list-type=ul>Have you picked up a different type over time?</li><li data-xf-list-type=ul>Does your typing lead you to identify with a particular Pokémon?</li><li data-xf-list-type=ul>Do you identify with a particular trainer of a particular type?</li></ul>This list is very,<i> very</i> subjective, with huge degrees of overlap – you may only associate with the ‘good’ part of one type and only the ‘bad’ part of another, you may feel that you associate with six of the traits listed, or you may disagree with the characterisation entirely. If you have a different take on how the types can be applied to human personalities, by all means share it here!<p><b>Dark</b> – Pragmatic and ambitious. At your best, there’s no tribulation you are unwilling to undertake to achieve your goals. At your worst, you progress in life at the expense of others and may even take pleasure in such.</p><p><b>Normal</b> – Adaptable and flexible. At your best, you can try your hand at just about any experience life throws at you and you have a broad range of skills. At your worst, you have no truly deep expertise or definition of your own.</p><p><b>Fire</b> – Passionate and bold. At your best, you are driven and care deeply about others and the world around you. At your worst, you are reckless, uncritical and let your emotions dictate your actions.</p><p><b>Electric</b> – Energetic and enthusiastic. At your best, you are highly motivated and productive; you do not procrastinate. At your worst, you lack patience and are prone to slapdash work or ill-conceived decisions.</p><p><b>Rock</b> – Tough and competitive. At your best, you achieve growth through challenge and are willing to fight to defend your ideals. At your worst, you are aggressive and uncomfortable when others do not rise to your competitive streak.</p><p><b>Water</b> – Calm and cool. At your best, you are unperturbed by events and never stop moving and working effectively. At your worst, your antipathy can make you directionless, and your life may be dictated by the flow of others.</p><p><b>Grass</b> – Optimistic and accommodating. At your best, you are perennially cheerful and help nurture others around you to grow through your positivity. At your worst, your benign worldview results in a lack of motivation and you are conflict-averse to the point of your own detriment.</p><p><b>Flying</b> – Adventurous and thrill-seeking. At your best, you broaden your horizons and build personal growth through travel and new experiences. At your worst, you can lose sight of life’s fundamentals when chasing new highs.</p><p><b>Fairy</b> – Imaginative and fanciful. At your best, your imagination grants you creative talent or the ability to rise above trivial problems. At your worst, your daydreaming can leave you with a willing obliviousness to real issues.</p><p><b>Ghost</b> – Philosophical and reserved. At your best, you can use your connection to history and/or spiritualism to find and share wisdom. At your worst, you are intimidated by the present and struggle to relate to contemporary problems.</p><p><b>Fighting</b> – Forthright and determined. At your best, you have no problem setting out into the world around you to right the wrongs and shape it as you see fit. At your worst, you can be self-righteous or bullying.</p><p><b>Bug</b> – Curious and quick to learn. At your best, you learn, grow and pick up new skills faster than most. At your worst, you can be obsessive and react poorly to those not as invested in your interests.</p><p><b>Dragon</b> – Confident and self-assured. At your best, your confidence leads you to seek excellence at everything you turn your hand to. At your worst, you are haughty and fail to understand those who don’t share your goals or sense of pride.</p><p><b>Psychic</b> – Intellectual and high-minded. At your best, you are clever and can deploy your mind to plan for and dissect obstacles in your way. At your worst, you are snobbish and lack emotional intelligence.</p><p><b>Poison</b> – Patient and collected. At your best, you are able to take your time and resolve issues through careful application of your skills. At your worst, your patience leaves you missing opportunities and neglecting your personal growth.</p><p><b>Ground</b> – Sensible and level-headed. At your best, you are a font of good advice and see the world in clear terms. At your worst, you can be outdated or blunt in your approach to life and people.</p><p><b>Ice</b> – Cold and dignified. At your best, you are always collected and able to resist the negative impulses of yourself and others. At your worst, you are perceived as being completely emotionless and lacking in empathy.</p><p><b>Steel</b> – Enduring and unyielding. At your best, you have a mental fortitude unrivalled by others and can bear almost any burden. At your worst, you struggle to adapt to new ideas and may cling to personal dogma.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHy4tMicn2aon6CyrrvNZquyqJVirrOxjLKmrmZibYB0fZVo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./halloween-spiral-slice-and-bake-cookies-recipe.html><span>←</span><span>Spiral Slice and Bake Halloween Cookies</span></a>
