Is this the same as the Celestica people? The real ones anyway, since we know the Diamond and Pearl clans call themselves Celestica after an earlier civilization that existed in Hisui, the one the old verses are about and that Cogita's stories are passed down from.<p>What did happen to them? It's really murky but somehow they were driven out of Hisui, seemingly not by any other humans because the time frame suggests that everyone else came much later, so possibly by a natural disaster? They already feared Giratina <i>before</i> their civilization fell, if what Volo tells us about the placement of the statue is correct, so it's unlikely to have been that. I've seen it theorized that they lost Arceus's favor, or at least believed they had, either of which would have fueled Volo's demand for answers.</p><p>But he doesn't even say he's one of them. He says he has their blood, that he's descended from them. He's still a young man, and they vanished at least a thousand years ago (no I don't buy the theory that he's immortal--he'd have a hell of a lot more answers if he was). A heritage means a lot to people, but this is a culture that simply hasn't existed since long before he was born. Even if it had continued (as it probably did in the Sinjoh region), it wouldn't be anything like it was then. So why does a past he wasn't part of, a people he's only vaguely related to, drive his every action and fuel his need for answers?</p><p>I suppose the closest I can come up with is that his sense of abandonment (referring to Giratina as an "unwanted child" sure seems like projection to me, combined with insisting that he's alone in the world despite having pokemon who love him and a bunch of people who seem to like him) cause him to cling to anything that gave him a sense of purpose or belonging, and if he was a Celestica/Sinnoh, then it meant he belonged in Hisui more than anyone else. "Outsider" seems to be his greatest insult for you, after all, and if he had always felt so removed and alone then surely he'd seen himself as an outsider quite often, but as part of an ancient bloodline, it made everyone else outsiders (well, except Cogita, who even if she isn't immortal is still the only other Celestica we see).</p><p>Well, that would explain his motivations anyway, but it still doesn't really answer who they were or why they vanished or if these two names really do refer to the same group. Any ideas?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHy4tM5mrp6qlWLBqbGMrKCnpp%2BderGxzqmjnmWRo7Fuw8eyZJ2nlah6tbTIrGSmnZGjerS7jKasnKBdqbxuws6lpmdqaWqAc4CO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mark-few-net-worth-232962.html><span>←</span><span>Mark Few Net Worth 2024</span></a>
