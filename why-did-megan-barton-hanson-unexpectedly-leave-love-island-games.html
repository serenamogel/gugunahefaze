It was just easy to talk to them and felt like something I could see over time turning maybe into something,” she gushed.</p><p data-characters=431 data-current-count=431 data-injectable=true>While things seemed to be smooth sailing between Megan and Kyra, things took a turn when Megan’s ex-boyfriend — Eyal Booker, also from season 4 of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Love Island: UK</a> — entered the villa.
