What does it imply if the battery light on my phone is flashing red? Either the battery is completely depleted or it is not receiving any charge. Once the battery is charging, the charger will display a red light, and if the battery is completely charged, the charger will display a green light.</p><p align=justify>People have also inquired as to why their charger is flashing red.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146 data-inserter-version=2></span><p align=justify>Occasionally, the charger may display a flashing red right light to warn that the batteries are faulty.
