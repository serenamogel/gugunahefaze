Ever since Wyatt’s return to the company in October, there has been no complete knowledge regarding his character.</p><p>Since his return, he wrestled his first match against Jinder Mahal on December 26th at a Live event in MSG. Wyatt again fought Mahal on December 29th at a live event. He reportedly got his finger injured during his fight on December 29th.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Dave Meltzer of the <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wrestling Observer Newsletter</a></strong> has now provided details on the injury. He has confirmed that the Former World Champion has suffered a finger injury in his left hand. Bray Wyatt hasn’t fought on live television as of yet, but it will soon happen.</p><p>“Wyatt suffered a broken finger on his left hand in his 12/29 match with Mahal in Miami. He will likely be working through the injury as talent working with broken fingers is commonplace.”</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“He was always thinking,” WWE Hall of Famer heaps admiration upon Bray Wyatt</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-la-knight-isn-t-afraid-of-bray-wyatt><strong><strong>LA Knight isn’t afraid of Bray Wyatt</strong></strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Adobe_Express_20230106_2001180_1-1024x576.jpg><p>After his return to the company in October, <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bray Wyatt </a></strong>began feuding with LA Knight. Wyatt and Knight have crossed paths numerous times after his return but haven’t fought against each other. On the December 30th edition of Friday Night SmackDown, LA Knight and the Eater of Worlds had a confrontation.</p><p>Wyatt stated that he has been patient all this time and can end it whenever he wants to. The Former Universal Champion accepted Knight’s challenge for a match at the Royal Rumble. The two were interrupted by Uncle Howdy, who then attacked Wyatt by delivering a Sister Abigail. Both men will face each other in a first-time-ever Pitch Black match. The rules of the match are unknown as of yet, but it has already got the WWE Universe excited.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>During a recent appearance on WWE’s The Bump, LA Knight stated that he doesn’t care who Uncle Howdy is and indicated that he isn’t afraid of Wyatt or Howdy.</p><p>“Is he Uncle Howdy, is he not Uncle Howdy? Did he do it, did he not do it, doesn’t really make a difference. He (Bray Wyatt) can’t even keep his own goons in order!”</p><p>Meanwhile, in the midst of this Uncle Howdy thing going on with Bray Wyatt, <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Alexa Bliss</a></strong> recently went into a trance. During the match with <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bianca Belair</a></strong>, Bliss saw the Wyatt logo on the screen and went crazy. She destroyed the EST of WWE by violently attacking her. The teases have been going on for quite a while now, and soon fans might see Bliss and Wyatt together again.</p><p>In case you missed:</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>“Then take a break,” WWE Hall of Famer shares his views on Rey Mysterio’s possible retirement</strong></a></p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Fight me!” Former Divas Champion challenges Charlotte Flair for a singles match against her</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiemafAtb%2FPqKmtsl6YvK571rCcZqaVrMBurtGasGavqZbBtXnIp6GuqqliwrGwwK2caA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kingler-pok-c3-a9mon.html><span>←</span><span>Kingler (Pokmon) - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</span></a>
