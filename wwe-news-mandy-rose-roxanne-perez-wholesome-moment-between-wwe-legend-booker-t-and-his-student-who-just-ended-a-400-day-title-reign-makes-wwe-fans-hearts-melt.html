A visual of the same has been portrayed by the 21-year-old wrestler, Roxanne Perez.&nbsp; Her wrestling career is as young as the wrestler herself. Yet, one cannot ignore her recent accomplishment in the wrestling world.</span></p><p><span>After winning in the women’s Iron Survivor Challenge at Deadline, Perez became the number one contender to NXT’s Championship. To win the title, she competed against the 32-year-old wrestler, Mandy Rose. Not only that, she eventually carved her name on the title by ending the 400+ day title reign.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>After witnessing this surreal moment, fans got overwhelmed. Their hearts melt seeing the emotional moment shared by Perez and her trainer, the legend Booker T.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><b>Fans react to a historic win&nbsp;</b></h2><p><span>Before Perez named the NXT Women’s Championship title to herself, it was under the reign of The Golden Goddess since October 2021. She defended her title at every cost and survived as a champion for over 400 days. Meanwhile, a well-trained WWE star was stepping her way up toward the title.</span></p><a href=# class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b transparent-card"><img id="img-tag-ufc-mma-news-nba-basketball-news-wwe-news-i-dont-see-why-recalling-ronda-rousey-and-her-take-on-shaquille-oneal-lasting-45-seconds-with-her?utm_campaign=internal_links&utm_medium=dive_deeper&utm_source=website-embed-image" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/Ronda-Rousey-2-3-425x315.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b card-content">“I Don’t See Why…” Recalling Ronda Rousey and Her Take on Shaquille O’Neal Lasting 45 Seconds With Her</p></a><p><span>After getting crowned as the new NXT Women’s Champion, Perez was left in tears. Besides her, there was someone else, who was more happy and proud than her. Even the cameras captured his glorious reaction.</span></p><p><span>Looking at which fans couldn’t stay away from pouring their emotions on social media. Even though everyone loved Rose and her long reign over the title, they also felt Perez is a deserving champion. The heartfelt reactions of WWE fans will definitely melt you. It’s their support and encouragement that pushes a wrestler to do more.</span></p><p><span>Some of those positive reactions are mentioned below. Mostly, people were delighted for Roxanne and congratulated her on the win.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Few of the observers pay attention to the bond between Booker T and Perez and his reaction after Roxanne wins the title.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>A fan went a step ahead and mentioned all the young wrestler’s achievements so far.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>While some are overjoyed, others are disappointed. They think this massive fight deserved a bigger stage rather than just a TV taping.</span></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>So happy for Roxanne!

He also confessed his pride and joy in looking at her grow from such a small age to now being a champion.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We all can just try to feel the emotions of Booker T.
